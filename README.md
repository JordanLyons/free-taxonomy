# free-taxonomy
A human service taxonomy based on Aunt Bertha's [Open Eligibility human services taxonomy](https://github.com/openreferral/openeligibility) and Open Referral's [Human Services Data Standard](https://github.com/openreferral/specification).

The CSV has fields based on the [taxonomy table in the Human Services Data Standard](http://docs.openreferral.org/en/latest/hsds/reference/#taxonomy), with additional fields corresponding to the [Sarapis's ORServices project](https://github.com/sarapis/orservices).

This taxonomy incorporates terms from the Open Eligibility GitHub repo as well as some that are listed on the website but not in the GitHub repo.

The original taxonomy had duplicate values of records that can be included in multiple parents. In this taxonomy, each record has only one value and is generally associated with whichever parent had a lower id number.
